# DebugGhost
Android Developer Tool

## What's this for?
The main goal is to loosely couple a development tool to your project (in a debug build-type or a certain product-flavour) without the need of a lot of if-else conditions, adding "debug-menu-items" to your action bar to run some test code and so on. In my case, the biggest need was getting my current sqlite database and having a look into it. That's where DebugGhost startet. DebugGhost runs a lightweight server in the context of your app. You can connect to it via WebBrowser from your development machine and browse the sqlite database and also download it.
DebugGhost does **not** use the adb. It uses WiFi, so your development machine has to be in the same local network and devices have to be able to find each other (that's not a givin in guest Wifis).

Current function:
* browse and download through your projects SQLite database
* view device infos
* send commands to your device
* read and write shared preferences

*more features are planned, but one step after another ;)*

## Getting started
Follow these steps to get DebugGhost up and running in your project:
* [include the lib in your project](../../wiki/1---Getting-started#include-the-lib-in-your-project) (only for debug build-type)
    * [as lib with jitpack.io](../../wiki/1---Getting-started#add-lib-with-jitpack.io) (no maven repo yet, sry)
    * [as module in your project](../../wiki/1---Getting-started#add-lib-as-module-in-your-project)
* [setup Application class](../../wiki/1---Getting-started#setup-application-class) 
    * [include DebugGhostBridge](../../wiki/1---Getting-started#include-Debugghostbridge)

[Here's a sample project for testing](https://github.com/sanidgmbh/debugghostexample)
